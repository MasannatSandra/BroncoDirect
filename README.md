# BroncoDirect Redesign - CS 2450 Project
BroncoDirect is a website designed for students to manage their account, financial aid, and classes. While the current site sees a lot of utility, it's usability is quite low, with small font sizes, an unfunctional back button, and confusing layout. Our aim is to create a more functional version with a JavaFX prototype.

This protype is horizontal and focuses more on the Student Center.
